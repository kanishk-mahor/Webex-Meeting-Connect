# Webex Meeting Connect 

Nowadays frequency of virtuals Meeting is increased and to join the Meeting is itself became a task. Sometime it happens we are stuck in some work and forget to join the Meeting on time which happens with me a lot. So to overcome this I use python Scripts to join the call on time.

Lets Discuss how it helps.

### Pre-requisites
- Webex Meeting Application
- python 3.x
- selenium
- pywinauto
- win32com
- Wbex Meeting invite
